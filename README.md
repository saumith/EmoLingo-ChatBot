## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshay-menta/EmoLingo-ChatBot.git
cd EmoLingo-ChatBot
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 🔐 Hugging Face Token Required

Hugging Face API tokens have been removed from the code for security purposes.

To use the application, you must insert **your own Hugging Face API token** manually in the code.

1. Go to [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) to generate a new token.
2. Open the relevant file (e.g., `emotion_classification.py` or `pipeline.py`) and locate the line where the token is used.
3. Replace the placeholder or comment with your actual token, like this:

```python
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN = "your_token_here"
```

3. **Set up the English Proficiency Model**

⚠️ Important: The English proficiency model is not stored in the repository due to size limitations. You must generate it before running the app.

Run the following command to create and save the model locally:

```bash
python Writing_proficiency.py
```
This step will save the model artifacts required by the ```app.py```.

4. **Run the Streamlit Application**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
